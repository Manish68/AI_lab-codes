# Part of Speech tagging using HunPos tagger and CRF++

Linear regression and logistic regression both are machine learning algorithms that are part of supervised learning models. Since both are part of a supervised model so they make use of labelled data for making predictions. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

There are no external libraries required for this lab question.

Python requirements:
  * copy
  * math
  * matplotlib.pyplot
  * pandas
  * pickle
  * sklearn

### Running on your system

```
  pip install requirements.txt
  
  ```

1. Linear Regression
  
  Type following commands on your terminal:
   
  ```
  python lin_regr_train.py
  
  python lin_regr_test.py
  
  ```
  
2. Logistic Regression
  
  Type following commands on your terminal:
   
  ```
  python log_regr_train.py
  
  python log_regr_test.py
  
  ```
NOTE: lin_theta and log_theta in the repo files would be auto generated when you run the above commands.
